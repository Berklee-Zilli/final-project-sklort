    <p>Html is a website language programmed to accept different conditions which will structure a website based on different binary systems and different logical flows and equations. The architecture is a cascading style of computing and will run at different speeds based on the connection to your conditionals.</p>
    <p>All your websites which you go on or navigate to are encoded in HTML and either are on HTML or don't exist as all the websites you use are encoded using HTML. </p>
