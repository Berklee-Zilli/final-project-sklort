# final-project-sklort
final-project-sklort created by GitHub Classroom. Project by Toby Hurrell.

I used w3schools, Mozilla Developer, https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/, and copied text from Wikipedia for this project.
No AI was used. 

The basic concept is that this is the website of a student taking an intro programming class. They use this website to upload their assignments and notes, with the end goal to have a functioning website.
