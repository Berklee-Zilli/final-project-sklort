LMSC-261 Final Project by Toby Hurrell. 

I used w3schools, Mozilla developer, https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/, and I copied text from Wikipedia. No AI was used for this project. 

The basic concept of my project is that this is the website of a student taking an intro programming course. They use this website to upload assignments and in-class examples, with the final goal of having a fully functional website. 

The website is posted on the github pages section of this repo. Just in case, here's the link https://berklee-zilli.github.io/final-project-sklort/ .
